  * Yunqing Zhao, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Xiao Yang, Chongxuan Li, Ngai-Man Cheung, Min Lin
  * **📝 Summary**: A novel approach that extracts backdoor functionality from infected models to enable accurate detection of backdoor inputs without requiring clean reference data.
  * **💡 Motivation**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Addresses the critical challenge of backdoor detection in practical scenarios where clean data is unavailable
  * **🔧 Method**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Innovative backdoor functionality extraction technique with strong theoretical foundation and empirical validation

* **[Towards Reliable and Efficient Backdoor Trigger Inversion via Decoupling Benign Features](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Tw9wemV6cb)** ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/ICLR'24-6c757d) [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/xuxiong0214/BTIDBF?style=social)](https://github.com/xuxiong0214/BTIDBF)
  * Xiong Xu1, Kunzhe Huang, Yiming Li, Zhan Qin1, Kui Ren
  * **📝 Summary**: Address the limitation of existing backdoor trigger inversion methods, where the generated triggers differ significantly from the actual triggers used by attackers.
  * **💡 Motivation**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Overcome the reliance of current methods on extracting backdoor features for trigger inversion.
  * **🔧 Method**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) - Mitigate the poor performance of current methods against backdoor attacks with only a minor footprint in the feature space.

* **[BAN: Detecting Backdoors Activated by Adversarial Neuron Noise](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Tw9wemV6cb)** ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/NeurIPS'24-6c757d)![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/CCF_A-dc3545) [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/xiaoyunxxy/ban?style=social)](https://github.com/xiaoyunxxy/ban)
  * Xiaoyun Xu, Zhuoran Liu, Stefanos Koffas, Shujian Yu, Stjepan Picek
  * **📝 Summary**: Address the excessive reliance of existing methods on the separability between benign and backdoor features, which also incurs high computational cost.
  * **💡 Motivation**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Observe that backdoored models are more sensitive than clean models to adversarial noise, and that neuron-level noise can be adversarially manipulated to reveal backdoor activations.
  * **🔧 Method**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) - Leverage neuron noise to substantially amplify backdoor effects, thereby improving the effectiveness of feature decoupling.

* **[Adversarial-Inspired Backdoor Defense via Bridging Backdoor and Adversarial Attacks](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/33030)** ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AAAI'25-6c757d)![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/CCF_A-dc3545)
  * Jia-Li Yin, Weijian Wang, Lyhwa, Wei Lin, Ximeng Liu
  * **📝 Summary**: Leveraging the intrinsic connection between adversarial attacks and backdoor attacks to effectively isolate poisoned samples and weaken the association between backdoor triggers and target labels.
  * **💡 Motivation**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - 1) the sample is harder to be turned into an adversarial examples when the trigger is presented; 2) the adversarial examples generated from backdoor samples are highly likely to be predicted as its true labels.
  * **🔧 Method**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Designed a clever top-q strategy to select poisoned samples.

* **[Activation Gradient based Poisoned Sample Detection Against Backdoor Attacks](https://openreview.net/forum?id=VNMJfBBUd5)** ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/ICLR'25-6c757d)
  * Danni Yuan, Shaokui Wei, Mingda Zhang, Li Liu, Baoyuan Wu
  * **📝 Summary**: By analyzing the distribution differences of activation gradients in the model, it effectively identifies target classes and distinguishes between clean and poisoned samples.
  * **💡 Motivation**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Backdoored models tend to map significantly different poisoned samples and clean samples to similar activation regions.
  * **🔧 Method**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Designed a novel class-level and sample-level selection method.
